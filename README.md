# DS3000 Final Project: Domestic Arrival Trends at Logan Airport

## Problem Statement

Commercial aviation delays cost passengers, airports, and airlines millions of dollars each year. They are caused by a wide variety of factors, including (but not limited to) weather conditions, time of year and day, originating airport, and more. With the hope of getting a better look at what really causes flight delays, we aim to explore the extent to which specific selected factors lead to flight delays. In particular, we aim to explore and evaluate the on-time domestic arrival statistics at Boston Logan International Airport and analyze how these factors affect flight punctuality throughout the year.

## Significance of the Problem

The advent of reliable commercial aviation was a milestone in accelerating the continuing worldwide process of globalization. Air travel is now a keystone of international trade and the transportation of passengers and cargo. By analyzing contributing factors to flight delays, we can identify potential problem areas in order to better improve passenger and cargo movement. As the primary airport for one of America’s most significant economic regions, Logan competes with other major airports across the United States. The insights from this project may prove useful in identifying competitive geographical and logistical advantages and shortcomings that Logan possesses in relation to other U.S. airports.

## Data

We obtained domestic arrival data for Logan International Airport from the [United States Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Arrivals.aspx), and weather data from [OpenWeatherMap’s historical data API](https://openweathermap.org/history-bulk). This data is available in CSV form in the [data directory](/data) of this repository.
